# New Strategy

-   Each class will begin with a breakout group "warm up"
-   Then we will shift to breakout "working groups"

# Breakout Etiquette

## Observations

-   Some groups have been vibrant, active, productive.
-   Some groups have been dead. One or two people talking, maybe. Other people
    not talking at all.

## Unmute

-   When in breakout rooms, I would *strongly encourage you* to unmute. In
    small groups, it works fine for everyone to be unmuted.
-   I'd also encourage you to turn on your cameras. It does make the whole
    thing feel more human!
-   If you are muted with the video off, you need to engage in the chat.

## No Lurking

-   Lurking is being there, muted, video off, and unresponsive in the chat.
-   Lurking kills the vibe.
-   If you can't talk, let everyone know this in the chat, and be active in
    the chat. 
-   If you can't engage, then these Zoom sessions won't be valuable
    for you! Seek out collaboration on Discord instead.
-   (Being pulled away isn't lurking. But let people know! Don't ghost.)

## Be Friendly, Inclusive, Supportive

-   I suspect some people are lurking because it is socially weird, and they
    don't know how to break in to the conversation.
-   Begin with introductions! Everyone should say "hi". These are people that
    can help you when you are stuck. It is worth getting to know each other.
-   Include everyone! If someone goes silent, reach out, and give them a
    chance to be heard. 

# Warm Up

## Horses, Tails, and Legs

-   Here is a riddle that is often attributed to Abraham Lincoln: *If we call
    a tail a leg, how many legs does a horse have?*
-   Task: Agree on an answer.
-   I will ask each group to share its answer and explanation when we return.
-   You have 5 minutes!

## Return

-   Share answers and explanations.

# Working Groups

## Some Reminders

-   Not everyone working on a given Unit will be on that for the same reason.
    Be sensitive to this.
-   Don't assume that everyone in your group is having the same experience you
    are.
-   Figure out what each of y'all are struggling with, and find ways to
    support each other.

## You Choose

-   Groups are organized by Unit.
-   You might be working on more than one Unit.
-   Pick the group you feel would be most valuable for you.
-   If you want to bail and switch to a different group, leave the group and
    let me know.

## Roles

-   Someone needs to be the screen sharer, and share the relevant document to
    the Zoom.
-   Someone needs to be the alerter. This is the person responsible for using
    the "Ask for Help" button to summon me!

## Unit 1

-   For people still working on Unit 1.
-   Task: read and discuss the material and the exercises.
-   Don't just *talk about how you plan to do it later*. Actually *do it*.
-   To join, rename yourself so your name *starts* with "1"

## Unit 2

-   For people still working on Unit 2.
-   Task: read and discuss the material and the exercises.
-   Don't just *talk about how you plan to do it later*. Actually *do it*.
-   To join, rename yourself so your name *starts* with "2"

## Unit 3

-   For people still working on Unit 3.
-   Task: read and discuss the material and the exercises.
-   Don't just *talk about how you plan to do it later*. Actually *do it*.
-   To join, rename yourself so your name *starts* with "3"

## Unit 3+

-   For people who feel like they have a handle on Unit 3, but want to
    push further.
-   Task: Keep working on the Carnap breakout room exercises from Tuesday
    (link in the chat)
