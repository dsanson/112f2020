# Warm Up

## Self-Refuting Positions

-   "I know that I know nothing" (a position sometimes attributed to Socrates)
-   "Nothing is true"
-   Both positions are self-refuting: if you think about them, you'll realize
    they can't be true.

## Breakout

-   Work out and explain why these positions are self-refuting.

# Working Groups

-   Don't just *talk about how you plan to do it later*. Actually *do it*.
-   To join, rename yourself so your name *starts* with "1", "2", "3", "4", or
    "5"
