## Agenda

-   Q&A: tech support, managing your time and all the stuff
-   Sarah's Puzzle: *One* clarification
-   Argument reconstruction and assessment:
    -   Breakout: reconstructing arguments
    -   Breakout: a passage from *Scarlet Letter*

## Tech Support?

-   Zoom?
-   Carnap.io?
-   Discord?
-   Reggienet?

## All the Stuff!!!

-   *ReggieNet*. Stable fixed course information: syllabus; links; gradebook
-   *Carnap*. Course content: reading, exercises, quizzes, tests
-   *Discord*. Course support and collaboration: chat, office hours, study
    groups
-   *Zoom*. Official "class meetings". Mostly collaboration in breakout rooms. 

## Managing Your Time, Given All the Stuff

-   Aim to complete one unit a week.
-   Sunday or Monday: Read the unit reading.
-   Tuesday through Thursday: Work on the unit exercises.
-   Wednesday or Thursday: Take the unit quiz.
-   Thursday or Friday: Take the unit test.

## So Much Stuff, So Little Time

-   3 credits: 3h/week in class; 6h/week outside class
-   4 classes = $9 \times 4 = 36$h/week.
-   5 classes = $9 \times 5 = 45$h/week.
-   Plus, for many of you, a job, plus COVID stress, plus Zoom exhaustion,
    plus...

## Sarah's Argument

:::{.standardform}

| 1. [One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
  death.]{.premise}
| 2. [One of Righty and Lefty is a knight, and the other is a
  knave.]{.premise}
| 3. [Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the
  castle.]{.premise}
| [The right door leads to the castle.]{.conclusion}

## Validity and Soundness

Validity
:   An argument is *valid* iff it is impossible for the premises to all be
    true but the conclusion false.

Soundness
:   An argument is **sound** iff it is valid and all of its premises are true.

Many of you pointed out reasons to doubt the truth of her *premises*. But
I asked you about the *validity* of her argument!

## Sarah's Puzzle, Continued

-   We have a lively discussion going on the Discord, in the #logic-puzzles
    channel.
-   Let's keep that going!

## Argument Reconstruction and Evaluation

-   Unit 1 introduces the basic concepts we use for argument reconstruction
    and evaluation.
-   These are: argument, premise, conclusion, implicit premise, validity, soundness.
-   I am not going to *lecture* about this!

## Breakout Room 

-   I have created several copies of the same Google Document. This document
    contains prompts for the three breakout room activities for today.
-   Once you are in your Breakout Room, figure out your Room number (it is at
    the top of the Zoom window).
-   In your chat, there will be links to the Google Documents, organized by
    Room number.
-   Open the link for your Room number.
-   *Everyone in your group* will be viewing and editing the same
    Google Document together.

## Breakout Activity One

-   There are a bunch of short arguments in the Google Document. Your task is
    to reconstruct them in standard form, identify any implicit premises, and
    then decide whether the argument is or isn't valid, and is or isn't sound.
-   There are more arguments than you will have time to get through. That is
    by design!
-   Summon me using the "Ask for Help" button if you need help. 

## Breakout Activity One Q&A

I want each group to briefly share something with us all from what they just
did. A question, an answer, a puzzle...

## Breakout Activity Two

-   In your Google Doc, you will find a long passage from *A Study
    in Scarlet*, in which Sherlock Holmes offers an argument for a certain
    conclusion.
-   Your task is to reconstruct that argument.

## Breakout Activity One Q&A

Any group want to share something with us all from what they just
did? A question, an answer, a puzzle...

## What You Should Be Doing

-   Take the Unit 1 Quiz and Unit 1 Test
-   Start in on Unit 2
    -   (I should have it up by the end of today.)
-   Keep talking on Discord.
-   Take a deep breath, and celebrate surviving your first week of this weird
    Fall term.
