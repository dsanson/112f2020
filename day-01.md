Let's look at it together.

Also, take a look at the Zoom ground rules.

    <https://illinoisstate.zoom.us/profile>.

    meeting.

## Unpacking the Puzzle

-   Logic is about reasoning.
-   Reasoning moves *from* some information *to* a conclusion.
    -   Sarah reasons *from* information the Guards give her, *to* the conclusion
    that the right door leads to the castle.
-   The information reasoned *from* is called the *premises*.
-   The information reasoned *to* is called the *conclusion*.
-   Question: does Sarah's conclusion *follow* from her premises?

## The First Two Premises

-   The guards volunteer two pieces of information:
    1.  One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
        death.
    2.  One of the guards always tells the truth, and the other one always lies.

## "Knights" and "Knaves"

-   This is what we call a "Knights and Knaves" puzzle:
-   Call someone who always tells the truth a *knight*, and someone who always
    tells the lies a *knave*.
-   There are lots of neat Knights and Knaves puzzles.

## The Third Premise

-   Call the guard on Sarah's left "Lefty" and the guard on her right "Righty."
-   Sarah asks Lefty a question. From his answer, she learns:
    3.  Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the castle.

## Sarah's Argument

:::{.standardform}

| 1. [One of the doors leads to the castle, and the other leads to certain
  death.]{.premise}
| 2. [One of Righty and Lefty is a knight, and the other is a
  knave.]{.premise}
| 3. [Lefty says that Righty would say that the left door leads to the
  castle.]{.premise}
| [The right door leads to the castle.]{.conclusion}

:::

## Breakout Room Activity

-   Does Sarah reason correctly from her premises to her conclusion?
-   What is her reasoning? (You might want to rewatch the video.)
-   Does she make a mistake?
-   Does the door she went through lead to the castle?

## Breakout Guidance

-   Introduce yourself! 
-   Take notes! Options:
    -   Zoom chat. (Easy but messy. Lost if not saved)
    -   Zoom whiteboard. (Save before breakout ends.)
    -   Google Doc, shared with editing privileges to everyone
        in the group. (Best solution IMHO.)
-   Use the "Ask for Help" button to summon me to your room.

## Returning from Breakout Rooms

-   Share what you've come up with!


## But...

Maybe we already discussed this! But just in case:

-   The right door did not lead to the castle. Nor did it lead to certain
    death.
-   This suggests that Sarah's *premises* weren't true. (The guards told her
    about the door, and that one of them is a knight and the other a knave.
    But what if they were lying?)

## Validity and Soundness

Validity
:   An argument is *valid* iff it is impossible for the premises to all be
    true but the conclusion false.

Soundness
:   An argument is **sound** iff it is valid and all of its premises are true.

-   Sarah's argument is valid, but is it sound?
