# Agenda

-   Annoucements: tech support; gradebook; retakes
-   Validity and Formal Validity (Breakout)
-   Validity and Ambiguity (Breakout)
-   Playing with our new (Unit 2) Symbols (Breakout)

# Announcements

## Tech Support/Updates

-   Carnap.io: how to check your scores; typo bounty 20XP
-   Discord: bot problems (@ me if your stats need adjusting)
-   Zoom XP not yet added (getting there!)
-   Reggienet Gradebook now available (not auto-updated)

## Gradebook

-   U1R is "Unit 1 Reading"; U1E, "Unit 1 Exercises", etc.
-   U1 is the unit itself: 0=incomplete, 60=nearly, 80=complete, or
    90=mastered.
-   Quiz and Test retakes: what you see is your *highest* score.

## Retakes

-   Guide for asking for retakes posted to the ReggieNet syllabus page.

# Validity and Formal Validity

## Definitions

Validity
:   An argument is *valid* iff it is impossible that all of its premises be
    true, but its conclusion false.

Formal Validity
:   An argument is *formally valid* iff every
    argument that shares its logical form is valid.

## Two Arguments{data-transition="fade"}

<div id=standardform>

| [The Pope is an unmarried man.]{.premise}
| [The Pope is unmarried.]{.conclusion}

</div>
<div id=standardform style='margin-top:2em' >

| [The Pope is a bachelor.]{.premise}
| [The Pope is unmarried.]{.conclusion}

</div>

## Formally Valid{data-transition="fade"}

<div id=standardform>

| [[The Pope]{.A} is an [unmarried]{.B} [man]{.C}.]{.premise}
| [[The Pope]{.A} is [unmarried]{.B}.]{.conclusion}

</div> 

<div id=standardform style='margin-top:2em' >

| [[Philosophy]{.A} is a [useless]{.B} [degree]{.C}.]{.premise}
| [[Philosophy]{.A} is [useless]{.B}.]{.conclusion}

</div>

## Not Formally Valid{data-transition="fade"}

<div id=standardform>

| [[The Pope]{.A} is a [bachelor]{.B}.]{.premise}
| [[The Pope]{.A} is [unmarried]{.C}.]{.conclusion}

</div>
<div id=standardform style='margin-top:2em' >

| [[The Sun]{.A} is a [star]{.B}.]{.premise}
| [[The Sun]{.A} is [green]{.C}.]{.conclusion}

## Breakout Activity

-   The point of this activity is to get you thinking about logical form.
-   The Google Doc has several arguments. Some are formally valid, others not.
-   Try to show that they aren't valid by constructing *counterexamples to
    formal validity*: arguments with the same form, that lead from true
    premises to a false conclusion.

# Validity and Ambiguity

## Ambiguous Sentences

Ambiguous Sentences
:   An *ambiguous sentence* is a sentence that has more
    than one possible meaning.

-   I caught the fish with the net.
-   It is good or it is bad and I like it.

## Breakout Activity

-   Work together on the Unit 2 Exercises on Ambiguity.

## Symbols

  Name             Symbol        English Meaning
  --------------- -------- ---------------------------
  Conjunction        ∧                'and'
  Disjunction        ∨                'or'
  Conditional        →           'if...then ...'
  Biconditional      ↔          'if and only if'
  Negation           ¬      'it is not the case that'

## Simple Sentences

  ----- ---------------------------
     ¬P It is not the case that P
    P→Q If P, then Q.
    P∧Q Both P and Q.
    P∨Q Either P or Q.
  ----- ---------------------------

## Valid Forms in Sentential Logic

<div id=standardform>

| [P→Q]{.premise}
| [?]{.premise}
| [?]{.conclusion}

</div>

## Breakout Activity

-   For each simple sentence, think about what follows from it, perhaps with
    the help of an additional premise.
-   The Google Doc has prompts.
