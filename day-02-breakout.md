# Breakout Room Activity One: Argument Reconstruction and Evaluation

What follows is a list of arguments. For each argument, I want you to do three
things:

A.  Reconstruct the argument in standard form: identify the conclusion and the
    premise(s), and list the premises (numbered), followed by the conclusion.

B.  Identify and include any implicit premises. Remember,

    Implicit Premise
    :   An implicit premise is an *unstated assumption* that the argument
        depends upon.

    You aren't looking for *unstated reasons to believe one of the explicitly
    stated premises*. And you aren't looking for *unstated further
    consequences*. You are looking for *unstated assumptions that are needed
    to make sense of the suggestion that the stated premises support the
    conclusion*.

C.  Assess the validity of the argument? Is it valid? Is it sound? (Note that
    in some cases, you won't be able to answer the second question, because
    you won't know whether the premises are actually true or actually false.
    If that's the case, just say so.

## Example

@.  It is okay for us to eat meat, since humans need to eat meat to be
    healthy.

Here is the argument:

>| 1. Humans need to eat meat to be healthy.
>| ∴ It is okay for humans to eat meat.

There is an unstated assumption, so an implicit premise. Here is my best guess
about how to make the argument explicit:

>| 1. Humans need to eat meat to be healthy.
>| 2. It is okay to do the things that we need to do to be healthy.
>| ∴ It is okay for humans to eat meat.

This argument is valid. But it isn't sound. The first premise is false. There
are plenty of healthy vegetarians. India alone has over 500 million
vegetarians. That is enough to show that the argument is not sound, since to
be sound, *all* of its premises must be true. But I also have doubts about the
truth of (2). If you and I are stuck together on a life raft, floating in
the ocean, with plenty of fresh water, but no food, is it okay for me to eat
you?

## Arguments

This is **WAY MORE** than you will have time to do in class. Feel free to pick
and choose which arguments you decide to reconstruct.

1.  Moby Dick is a whale. So Moby Dick is a mammal.

2.  Americans believe in freedom, so any law that restricts our freedom should
    be abolished.

3.  Nearly every student in the class scored less than 70% on the exam. This
    entails that the exam was too difficult to accurately assess student
    learning and therefore, since exams are supposed to accurately assess
    student learning, the exam must be revised and readministered.

4.  A robust economic recovery will require higher taxes on the wealthy, and
    we need to have a strong recovery to prevent another economic meltdown in
    the near future, so we must raise taxes on the wealthy.

5.  It should not be illegal for adults to smoke pot. After all, it does not
    harm anyone.

6.  Trees are beautiful, so we should plant more of them.

7.  Insofar as the losing candidate received a majority of the popular votes,
    and given that we live in a democracy, we may conclude that the election
    went against the basic principles of our country.

8.  The job market is terrible, I have to have a steady income to support my
    family, and I already have a stable job, so I shouldn't go to grad school.

9.  No one even cares what you think, so what you think isn't important.

10. There is nothing wrong with texting during lectures. Other students do it
    all the time.

11. Borders are not necessary. The concept of a closed border came about
    fairly recently in human history and having hard borders only creates
    violence and a coercive market for human trafficking.

12. We've always been honest with each other and the honest thing to do right
    now is to tell you that that outfit is terrible, so I need to tell you the
    truth about that outfit.

13. Giving students a failing grade will damage their self-confidence.
    Therefore, we should not fail students.

14. As there has never been a storm of such strength in the Florida Keys, one
    must conclude that there is not likely to be a storm of such strength in
    the Florida Keys in the years to come.

15. We should keep spending more on the military every year. China is only
    becoming more of a threat.

16. We need to protect the environment, since biodiversity is necessary to
    protect future food sources and biodiversity is sustainable only in a
    relatively healthy global environment. Furthermore, we take great pleasure
    in the natural wonders that the Earth has to offer \[What is the role of
    this last sentence?\]

17. Traces of ammonia have been found in Mars' atmosphere. So there must be
    life on Mars.

18. Carbon emissions contribute to global warming, so we should tax them.

19. Policing is inherently unjust. Communities in our society should be able
    to regulate themselves.

20. All of the nurses have gone on the strike, the custodial staff is
    threatening the same, and the doctors are demanding better legal support.
    This hospital is a mess right now.

21. I don't like people who spit on the sidewalk, so littering should be
    illegal.

22. Why should we save the wetlands, you ask? Simple: because wetlands protect
    us during storms as they slow water flows and surges.

23. Eating healthy food is important and Figs are super healthy, so we should
    eat more figs.

24. We already have almost all of the technology needed to clone dinosaurs and
    (human beings have a tendency to do whatever they find they can do. So,
    killer dinosaurs will soon roam the Earth.

# Breakout Room Activity Two: A Passage from *A Study in Scarlet*

*A Study in Scarlet* is the first Sherlock Holmes novel, written by Arthur
Conan Doyle, and published in 1887.

> "Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I
> told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan." "You
> were told, no doubt." "Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from
> Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my
> mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of
> intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning
> ran, 'Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military
> man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for
> his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his
> wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face
> says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and
> unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have
> seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The
> whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you
> came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished."

This passage includes both an argument, and some *reasoning*. Can you
reconstruct the *argument*? What are the basic premises---the information
Holmes starts from? And what is the ultimate conclusion---the claim Holmes
reasons to?

Once you have the argument reconstructed, can you also unpack the reasoning?

# Breakout Room Activity Three: Symbols for Propositional Logic

I just introduced five *connectives*:

  connective      basic meaning       symbol   how to type it
  --------------- ------------------ -------- -----------------
  negation        "not"                 ¬      `~`
  conditional     "if-then"             →      `->`
  conjunction     "and"                 ∧      `/\`
  disjunction     "or"                  ∨      `\/`
  biconditional   "if and only if"      ↔      `<->`



I also introduced the "canonical reading" for each connective:

  connective       canonical reading
  ---------------  --------------------------
   ¬P              it is not the case that P
   (P→Q)           (if P, then Q)
   (P∧Q)           (both P and Q)
   (P∨Q)           (either P or Q)
   (P↔Q)           (P iff Q)

I want you to translate each of the following symbolic sentences into their (clunky)
canonical readings in English. This is something you do in two steps:
     
a.  Replace each connective with its canonical English equivalent. Pay
    attention to the details: don't drop any parentheses. Don't drop words
    like 'both' or 'then'. Don't switch the order of things around. Don't
    try to "simplify". We will talk about all of that later!
b.  Replace each sentence letter with the English sentence in the key.

Then I want you to

c.  Briefly talk together about what the (clunky) canonical English sentence
    means.
d.  Try writing the same thing in less clunky English, by carefully removing
    parts that aren't essential. 

This last step is *dangerous*. Don't switch the order of things around. Don't
try to "simplify" or "distribute" or borrow any other ideas from algebra.

Key:

| P: I am happy.
| Q: I am quiet.
| R: I am tired.

1.  ¬(P→Q)

    Example Answer:

    a.  it is not the case that (if P, then Q)
    b.  it is not the case that (if I am happy, then I am quiet)
    c.  This means that '(if I am happy, then I am quiet)' isn't true. Maybe
        it is a way of saying that, sometimes, when I am happy, I am loud?
    d.  It is not the case that if I am happy, I am quiet.

2.  ¬Q
3.  (Q→R)
4.  (P∧Q)
5.  (~P∧~R)
6.  (Q∨R)
7.  (P↔Q)
8.  (R→¬P)
9.  ¬(P∧R)
10. ¬(Q∨R)
11. ¬(R→¬P)
12. (P→(R→Q))
13. ((P∧R)→Q)
14. (P↔P)
