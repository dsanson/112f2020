# Breakout Activities for August 25th

<!--Notes

This was too hard, and the instructions were not clear enough.

Revisions:

-   Rewrite Units 1 and 2 to do a better job of introducing formal validity
-   Focus on *counterexamples to formal validity*
-   Restructure the questions too.

What worked better:

| T: Simba is a lion.
| T: ∴ Simba is a mammal.

| T: ?
| F: ∴ ?

I think maybe I need to introduce this basic task: a chart, asking you to
evaluate truth and falsehood of premises and conclusion in a given situation,
possible or actual. So, an informal row of truthtable. Roughly, this:

~~~
[ ] Simba is a lion.
[ ] Simba is a mammal.
~~~

Where the student can put "T" or "F" into the box.

Then I could introduce, for counterexamples to formal validity, variation:

~~~
 T  [          ]
 F  [          ]
~~~

Where the student has to put in other sentences of the same form into the
boxes.

## Breakout Activity One

The point of this activity is to get you thinking about logical form.
This section has several arguments, some valid, some not. For each argument:

1.  First, try constructing a *counterexample to the validity* of the
    argument, by describing a possible situation in which the premises are
    true but the conclusion false.
2.  Second, try constructing a *counterexample to the formal validity* of the
    argument, by describing another argument with the same form, whose
    premises are true and whose conclusion is false.
3.  Try to think about what the form is that the two arguments have in common.

I've done this for the first argument as an example.

### Arguments

@. Argument:

| Some dogs bark.
| Some dogs chase cats.
| ∴ Some dogs both bark and chase cats.

1.  Counterexample to validity: imagine that there are only dogs in Illinois
    and Wisconsin. Imagine that all the dogs in Wisconsin bark, but none of
    the dogs in Illinois do. And imagine that all the dogs in Illinois chase
    cats, but none of the dogs in Wisconsin do.

2.  Counterexample to *formal* validity:

| Some cities are in Wisconsin.
| Some cities are in Illinois.
| ∴ Some cities are both in Wisconsin and Illinois.

3.   The arguments seem to have the same form. Roughly, it goes like this:

| Some As are Bs.
| Some As are Cs.
| ∴ Some As are both Bs and Cs.

@. Argument:

| If it is raining, then the streets are wet. 
| The streets are wet.
| ∴ It is raining.

@. Argument:

| If it is raining, then the streets are wet. 
| It is raining.
| ∴ The streets are wet.

@. Argument:

| Either it rains or it pours.
| It doesn't rain.
| ∴ It pours.

@. Argument:

| Simba is a lion.
| ∴ Simba is a mammal.

@. Argument:

| You can dance if you want to.
| You don't want to dance.
| ∴ You can't dance. 

@. Argument:

| I am happy and I know it.
| ∴ I am happy.

@. Argument:

| I know I am happy.
| ∴ I am happy.

## Breakout Activity Two 

This time, I want y'all to work together on [Exercises
2.1-2.10](https://carnap.io/assignments/ISU_112_FALL_2020/Unit%202%20Exercises).

If you get stuck, you might want to read together the reading on [Ambiguity
and
Validity](https://carnap.io/assignments/ISU_112_FALL_2020/Unit%202%20Reading#ambiguity-and-the-idea-of-an-artificial-language)
from the Unit 2 Reading.

## Breakout Activity Three

The idea here is to give you all a chance to think about how our logic
*should* work before I tell you how it *will* work.

@.  What follows from a negation?

Suppose you have, as a premise---a piece of information you want to reason
from---the fact that *it is not the case that P*, for some sentence P. For
example, it could be:

-   It is not the case that the earth is flat.

But I don't want you to make any assumption about what P is. I just want you
to think about what follows, as a matter of formal validity, from a sentence
of the form:

-   ¬P

*Sample Response*:

The trick here is to realize that nothing much interesting follows from ¬P all
by itself. But lots of things follow when you *combine* ¬P with other pieces
of information. For example,

-   From ¬P and P∨Q, Q follows.

For example

| It is not the case that the earth is flat.
| Either the earth is flat or the earth is round.
| ∴ The earth is round.

@. What follows from a conditional, like P→Q?

@. What follows from a conjunction, like P∧Q?

@. What follows from a disjunction, like P∨Q?

@. What does a conjunction follow from? That is, what premises would *need* if
you wanted to infer P∧Q?
