# Warm Up

## Two Theorems

-   `P->P` and `Q->(P->Q)` are both *theorems* in our system. They can be
    derived from no premises.
-   That's because they are both *logical truths* in our system. Sentences
    that are true in virtue of their logical form.
-   I want you to briefly discuss each sentence, and think about *why* each
    one has this status, and whether you agree that it should.

# Working Groups

## Breakout Room Reminders

-   introduce yourselves!
-   no lurking! 
-   be inclusive! be supportive!

## Units 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7

-   Task: read and discuss the material and the exercises.
-   Don't just *talk about how you plan to do it later*. Actually *do it*.
-   To join, rename yourself so your name *starts* with "1", "2", "3", "4", or
    "5", "6", "7"

# To Do 

-   Make progress!
-   Retake!
