# Warm Up

## A Puzzling Theorem

-   "$Q \rightarrow  (P \rightarrow  Q)$" is a *theorem*. It can
    be derived from no premises.
-   That means it is a *logical truth*. It is guaranteed to be
    true, just in virtue of its logical form.
-   "If go to ISU, then if you go to Michigan State, you go to ISU."
    -   Is this even true? How can it be a logical truth?

# Working Groups

## Units 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7

-   Task: read and discuss the material and the exercises.
-   Don't just *talk about how you plan to do it later*. Actually *do it*.

    "5", "6", "7"
