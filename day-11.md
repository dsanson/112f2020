# Warm Up

## Contradiction

> A judge in a village court had gone on vacation. Nasrudin was asked to be
> temporary judge for a day. Nasrudin sat on the Judge's chair with a serious
> face, gazing around the public and ordered the first case be brought-up for
> hearing.
>
> "You are right," said Nasrudin after hearing one side.
>
> "You are right," he said after hearing the other side.
>
> "But both cannot be right," said a member of public sitting in the audience.
> "You are right, too" said Nasrudin.

## Questions

-   What do you think of Nasrudin's response?
-   What is the difference "respecting both sides of a debate" and
    contradiction?
