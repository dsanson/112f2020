# A Real World Example

## Overtime Law in Maine

:::{.incremental}

-   A Maine law required time-and-a-half for overtime, but not for those
    involved in:

    > the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing,
    > packing for shipment or distribution of (1) agricultural produce; (2) meat
    > and fish products; and (3) perishable foods.

-  Several milk delivery truck drivers, who were not receiving time-and-a-half
   for overtime, sued.

:::

## The Ambiguity

> ...freezing, drying, marketing, storing, [packing for shipment or
> distribution]{.wavy}...

:::{.incremental}

-  The milk truck drivers distribute milk, but they do not pack milk for
   shipment or distribution.
-  Does the law exclude them from overtime or not?

:::

## Disambiguation

:::{.incremental}

-   The employer's interpretation:

    > ...freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment, or
    > distribution...

-   The driver's interpretation:

    > ...freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing (for shipment or
    > distribution)...

# The Comma Rule

## The Comma Rule

**Comma Rule**:
:   When a sentence would otherwise be ambiguous, a comma indicates a bigger
    structural break.

| 

::: {.incremental}

-   This isn't an observation about actual English usage.
-   It is an assumption we will make for the sake of clarity, in this class.
-   It is a rule I would encourage you to follow in your own writing.

:::


## Example 1

::: {.incremental}

-   P if Q or R
    -   ambiguous
-   P, if Q or R
    -   $(Q\vee R)\rightarrow P$
-   P if Q, or R
    -   $(Q\rightarrow P)\vee R$

:::

## Example 2

::: {.incremental}

-   P only if Q just in case R
    -   ambiguous
-   P, only if Q just in case R
    -   $P\rightarrow (Q\leftrightarrow R)$
-   P only if Q, just in case R
    -   $(P\rightarrow Q)\leftrightarrow R$

:::

## Example 3

::: {.incremental}
-   P but not Q unless R
    -    ambiguous
-   P, but not Q unless R
    -    $P\wedge (\neg Q\vee R)$
-   P but not Q, unless R
    -    $(P\wedge \neg Q)\vee R$
:::

## Example 4

::: {.incremental}
-   P if and only if Q and R or S
    -   ambiguous
-   P if and only if Q, and R or S
    -   $(P \leftrightarrow  Q) \wedge  (R \vee  S)$
-   P if and only if Q and R, or S
    -   ambiguous
-   P, if and only if Q and R or S
    -   ambiguous
