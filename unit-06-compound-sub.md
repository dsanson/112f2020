# Compound Subjects

## Example 1

:::{.incremental}
-   "Bob and Carol are here"
-   "Bob is here and Carol is here"
:::

## Example 2

:::{.incremental}
-   "Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice are here"
-   "Bob is here and Carol is here and Ted is here and Alice is here"
:::

## Example 3

:::{.incremental}
-   "Ted or Alice will know"
-   "Ted will know or Alice will know"
:::

## Compound Subjects

-   A compound subject term is a subject term created by combining several
    terms together, using one of our sentential connectives.
-   Sentences with compound subject terms can often be "unpacked" into
    compound sentences---that is, equivalent sentences composed of sentences
    joined by our sentential connectives.

## But Not Always

:::{.incremental}
-   "Ted and Alice are married."
-   This does not mean:
    -   "Ted is married and Alice is married"
-   It means:
    -   "Ted and Alice are married to each other"
:::

## But Not Always

::: {.incremental}
-   "Bob and Ted are a couple."
-   This does not mean:
    -   "Bob is a couple and Ted is a couple"
-   It means that they are a couple *together*
:::

# Compound Predicates

## Example 1

:::{.incremental}
-   "Bob is either here or in Los Angeles"
-   "Bob is here or Bob is in Los Angeles"
:::

## Example 2

:::{.incremental}
-   "Alice is angry but hasn't left."
-   "Alice is angry but Alice hasn't left."
:::

## Example 3

:::{.incremental}
-  "Ted drinks only if stressed."
-  "Ted drinks only if Ted is stressed."
:::

# Ambiguity

## Example 1

::: {.incremental}
-   "Bob and Alice are here but Ted and Carol are not."
-   "(Bob and Alice are here) but (Ted and Carol are not)"
-   A sentence with a compound subject or predicate "acts as a unit" in the
context of a larger compound sentence.
-   We can use this fact to figure out the structure of English sentences.
:::

## Example 2

::: {.incremental}
-   "Carol went on a walk if Alice and Ted are at the party"
-   "Carol went on a walk if (Alice and Ted are at the party)"
-   "W if (P and T)"
-   $(P \wedge  T) \rightarrow  W$
:::

## Example 3

::: {.incremental}
-   Ted drinks if stressed and Alice drinks if relaxed.
-   (Ted drinks if stressed) and (Alice drinks if relaxed)
-   (T if S) and (P if Q)
-   $(S\rightarrow T)\wedge (Q\rightarrow P)$
:::

## Example 4

::: {.incremental}
-   Bob is neither here nor at the party but Carol and Alice are at the party.
-   (Bob is neither here nor at the party) but (Carol and Alice are at the
    party).
-   (neither P nor Q) but (R and S)
-   $\neg (P\vee Q) \wedge  (R \wedge  S)$
:::

# Summary

-   Sentences containing compound subjects and predicates are often (but not
    always!) short for compound sentences.
-   A sentence with a compound subject or predicate "acts as a unit" in the
    context of a larger compound sentence.
