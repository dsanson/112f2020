# Warm Up

## Mullā Nasr al-Dīn

[![17th Century Minature of Nasr
al-Dīn](img/nasreddin.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nasreddin_(17th-century_miniature).jpg){style="float:right"}

Nasr al-Dīn (aka Nasruddin/Nasreddin) is a "wise fool" character from Middle
Eastern folklore, associated with Sufism, perhaps based on an actual 13th
century philosopher who lived in present-day Turkey.

## Across the River

> Naṣr al-Dīn is sitting by a river and sees a traveler arrive at the far
> shore.
>
> The traveler looks around, and then calls out, "How do I get across?"
>
> "What do you mean?" asks Naṣr al-Dīn. "You're already across!" (Adamson
> (2016) *Philosophy in the Islamic World* §49)

## Is Truth Relative?

-   Is truth relative or absolute?
-   The truth of given sentence is often relative to who is speaking, where
    they are, what time it is, etc.
    -   "I am David Sanson": true for me, not true for you.
    -   "It is raining": true in some places at some times, not others.
    -   "The traveler is across the river": across from where Nasr al-Din is;
        not across from where the traveler is.
-   This is another source of potential confusion in natural languages. Maybe
    our symbolic language should avoid it?

## The King and the Truth

> The King declares that he will tolerate no deviations from the truth, and
> that anyone who tells a lie in his city will be executed. Naṣr al-Dīn goes
> to the city, presents himself at the gates, and is asked what his business
> is. "I'm here to be executed," he says. (Adamson §49; Shah, *The Sufis*
> (1964, 60)
